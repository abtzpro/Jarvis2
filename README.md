# Jarvis2 AI
The real life Ironman JARVIS AI

## JARVIS2 AI Project

The JARVIS2 AI Project is an ambitious endeavor by Adam Rivers to replicate a real-life JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System), akin to that seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the Iron Man movies. Our JARVIS is designed with capabilities in diverse areas, including machine learning, deep learning, web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, reinforcement learning, and much more.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: JARVIS2 utilizes a Sequential model from TensorFlow for varied tasks like classification, regression etc.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: JARVIS2 employs both the DQN and the PPO algorithms from stable_baselines3, interacting with environments from OpenAI's gym.

- **Web Content Fetching**: The AI can fetch and parse web content using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

- **Unsupervised Learning**: For clustering needs, JARVIS2 has KMeans algorithm implementation.

- **Knowledge Base**: Neo4j graph database is leveraged for maintaining a robust and scalable knowledge base.

- **Conversational Abilities**: Enabled by HuggingFace's Transformers library, JARVIS2 possesses advanced conversational capabilities.

- **Speech Recognition**: The AI can recognize and understand spoken language using the `speech_recognition` Python library.

- **Computer Vision**: JARVIS2 'sees' and processes visual data with a pre-trained model in OpenCV.

- **Predictive Models**: JARVIS2 uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for making predictive decisions.

- **Emotion Recognition**: An emotion AI model is included that helps JARVIS2 understand human emotions from audio inputs.

- **IoT Integration**: Interfacing with the Home Assistant platform allows JARVIS2 to control IoT devices.

- **Personal Assistant Tasks and Scheduling**: The AI can manage tasks and schedules.

## Usage

The primary class is `JarvisAI`. After creating an instance of this class, users can access the various functionalities.

```python
# Create a JarvisAI object
jarvis = JarvisAI(model, agent, driver, chatbot)

# Get a prediction from the model
prediction = jarvis.predict(data)

# Fetch web content
soup = jarvis.fetch_web_content("http://example.com")
```

## Installation

To run the JARVIS2 AI project, you'll need to install several libraries and frameworks, including TensorFlow, sklearn, transformers, stable_baselines3, neo4j, BeautifulSoup, gym, speech_recognition, cv2, wikipedia, and wolframalpha. 

Ensure all the file paths, URLs, and credentials (for example, Wolfram Alpha App ID, Neo4j authentication) in the script are correctly set up.

## Placeholder Functions

The JARVIS2 AI script currently includes a few placeholder functions. They are methods that have been defined but currently lack a concrete implementation. The purpose of these placeholders is to outline the desired functionality and serve as a guide for future development. Here's a brief description of them:

1. `understand_emotion`: This method is intended to analyze the emotional content of an audio input using a pre-trained emotion recognition model. The placeholder is a call to the emotion model's `predict` method, but the preprocessing steps required to convert raw audio data into a suitable format for the model are not yet implemented.

2. `generate_text`: This function is a placeholder for generating conversational responses from JARVIS2. It uses a GPT-3 model to generate text based on a given prompt. Note that to utilize this, you need to have a GPT-3 model readily available.

3. `make_predictive_decision`: This function serves as a placeholder for making predictions based on a data input using a pre-trained predictive model. At present, it calls the `predict` method of an SVM model but doesn't specify how the model is trained or how the input data should be preprocessed.

It's **important to note** that to fully utilize these placeholder functions, you'll need to provide a suitable dataset, perform necessary preprocessing, train or fine-tune the model, and possibly modify the method to suit your specific needs.

## Active-Dev Disclaimer 
Please note that the JARVIS2 AI Project is still in the active development stage. As such, it is likely to contain bugs, glitches, or other issues. These may affect the project’s stability and performance. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work diligently to iron (man) out these issues and improve the system. Please feel free to report any bugs or problems you encounter, and we’ll do our best to address them promptly. We welcome all feedback and suggestions that can help enhance the development and effectiveness of this project. Thank you for your support!
