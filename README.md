# Jarvis2 AI

A real life Jarvis AI from Iron Man

## About
Jarvis2 incorporates various functionalities and libraries to enable neural network modeling, reinforcement learning, web browser integration, unsupervised learning, knowledge base querying, chatbot interactions, multi-modal abilities, predictive modeling, emotion recognition, IoT device management, personal assistant tasks, and integration of all components.

## How does Jarvis2 Work?

1. Neural Network Model: This part of the script demonstrates how to create a simple neural network model using TensorFlow.

2. DQL and Reinforcement Learning: This part of the script showcases how to use the stable_baselines3 library to implement Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and learn from an environment (CartPole-v1).

3. Web Browser Integration: This part of the script illustrates how to fetch and parse web content using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. Remember to replace the URL with your desired target URL.

4. Unsupervised Learning: This part of the script demonstrates how to use the sklearn library to perform unsupervised learning with the K-means clustering algorithm.

5. Knowledge Base: This part of the script showcases how to connect to a Neo4j graph database using the neo4j library and execute queries.
	
6. Chatbot Functions: This part of the script demonstrates the usage of the transformers library for text generation tasks. It utilizes the GPT-2 model and tokenizer to generate responses to user questions.

7. Multi-modal abilities: This section includes two functions:
	•	Speech Recognition: Uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture and process audio input.
	•	Computer Vision: Uses the OpenCV library to perform object detection in images. Remember to replace the file paths with your actual paths.

8. Predictive Model: This part of the script showcases how to use the sklearn library to create and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predictive modeling.

9. Emotion AI Model: This part of the script demonstrates how to use the tensorflow.keras library to load and utilize a pre-trained emotion recognition model. Remember to replace the path to your actual model.

10. IoT device management: This part of the script illustrates how to interact with a Home Assistant instance using the homeassistant library. Remember to replace the URL with your actual Home Assistant URL.

11. Personal assistant tasks and scheduling: This section provides a placeholder dictionary (personal_calendar) to store user’s schedules. Modify and extend it to suit your needs.

12. Wolfram Alpha for accessing factual information: This part of the script showcases how to use the wolframalpha library to query Wolfram Alpha for factual information. Remember to replace the ‘your-wolfram-alpha-app-id’ with your actual Wolfram Alpha App ID.

13. Multitasking via Python threading: This section includes a threading example to showcase concurrent execution of tasks.

14. Integration of all components: This section includes a class (JarvisAI) that integrates all the components mentioned above. It provides methods for prediction, decision making, web content fetching, knowledge base querying, chatbot interactions, listening, image processing, emotion recognition, advanced decision making, predictive decision making, and text generation.

## Disclaimer
Jarvis 2 is still VERY MUCH a work in progress development, and as such, bugs, glitches, and unforseen issues may arise. Current testing is limited due to developing from a mobile platform. (Machines to be up again soon)
