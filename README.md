# Jarvis2 AI
The real life Ironman JARVIS AI

## JARVIS2 AI Project

The JARVIS2 AI Project is an ambitious endeavor by Adam Rivers to replicate a real-life JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System), akin to that seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the Iron Man movies. Our JARVIS - JARVIS2, is designed with capabilities in diverse areas, including machine learning, deep learning, web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, reinforcement learning, and much more.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: JARVIS2 utilizes a Sequential model from TensorFlow for varied tasks like classification, regression etc.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: JARVIS2 employs both the DQN and the PPO algorithms from stable_baselines3, interacting with environments from OpenAI's gym.

- **Web Content Fetching**: The AI can fetch and parse web content using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

- **Unsupervised Learning**: For clustering needs, JARVIS2 has KMeans algorithm implementation.

- **Knowledge Base**: Neo4j graph database is leveraged for maintaining a robust and scalable knowledge base.

- **Conversational Abilities**: Enabled by HuggingFace's Transformers library, JARVIS2 possesses advanced conversational capabilities.

- **Speech Recognition**: The AI can recognize and understand spoken language using the `speech_recognition` Python library.

- **Computer Vision**: JARVIS2 'sees' and processes visual data with a pre-trained model in OpenCV.

- **Predictive Models**: JARVIS2 uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for making predictive decisions.

- **Emotion Recognition**: An emotion AI model is included that helps JARVIS2 understand human emotions from audio inputs.

- **IoT Integration**: Interfacing with the Home Assistant platform allows JARVIS2 to control IoT devices.

- **Personal Assistant Tasks and Scheduling**: The AI can manage tasks and schedules.

# How to Use the JARVIS2 AI Script

This script provides a basic skeleton of an AI system inspired by JARVIS from the Iron Man films. It's designed to be flexible and modular, allowing for extensive customization based on your specific requirements. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to use the script:

1. **Installation**
   To run the script, first, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can do this by using pip, a package manager for Python. Install the libraries with the following command:
   
   ```
   pip install tensorflow sklearn transformers stable-baselines3 neo4j requests bs4 gym speechrecognition opencv-python scikit-learn keras wikipedia wolframalpha homeassistant
   ```
   
2. **Configuration**
   Before running the script, you need to set up a few things:
   - Replace all instances of `'path_to_'` with the actual paths to your files. For example, the path to your emotion model, the path to your Computer Vision model, etc.
   - Set up your Neo4j database, and replace `'localhost:7687'` and `('neo4j', 'password')` with your actual Neo4j bolt URI and credentials.
   - Replace `'your-wolfram-alpha-app-id'` with your actual Wolfram Alpha app ID.
   - Replace `'http://your-home-assistant-url'` with your actual Home Assistant URL.
   
3. **Running the Script**
   You can then run the script using Python by navigating to the directory where the script is located and running `python jarvis.py` from the command line. 
   
   However, keep in mind that this script is not a complete implementation. It is a skeleton meant to provide a starting point for building an AI system like JARVIS. You will need to fill in many of the details, like training the models, managing the datasets, and defining the specific behaviors you want from your AI.
   
4. **Extending the Script**
   One of the primary goals of this script is to provide a modular starting point for building a complex AI system. This means you can easily extend it with new functionality:
   - You can add new methods to the `JarvisAI` class.
   - You can replace the models used for various tasks with ones that better suit your needs.
   - You can integrate with other systems and services to provide more features. 

Remember, this is a complex project that involves many different fields of AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, and more. You'll likely need a strong understanding of these topics to fully utilize and customize this script.

## Interacting with JARVIS2 
Interacting with the JarvisAI model, as defined in the jarvis.py script, involves initializing the JarvisAI object and then calling the desired methods for various functionalities. Here is a step-by-step guide:

First, you initialize the JarvisAI model:

jarvis = JarvisAI(model, agent, driver, chatbot)

The model, agent, driver, and chatbot are instances of the Neural Network Model, Reinforcement Learning Agents, Knowledge Base, and the Chatbot Functions respectively, which have been defined earlier in the jarvis.py script.

Following are a few examples of how to interact with the Jarvis2AI model:

	1.	Ask Jarvis a Question
You can ask Jarvis a question using natural language as follows:

question = "What's the weather like today?"
answer = jarvis.ask_jarvis(question)
print(answer)

	1.	This will print the response of Jarvis to your question.
	2.	Fetch Web Content
You can use Jarvis to fetch and parse web content as follows:

url = "http://example.com"
soup = jarvis.fetch_web_content(url)
print(soup.prettify())

	2.	This will print the parsed HTML content from the specified URL.
	3.	Query Knowledge Base
You can query your knowledge base (which is a Neo4j database as per your script) using the Jarvis AI:

query = "MATCH (n) RETURN n"
result = jarvis.query_knowledge_base(query)
print(result)

	3.	This will print the result of the Neo4j query.
	4.	Make Decisions Based on Observations
Jarvis can make decisions based on observations from the gym environment:

observation = env.reset()
action = jarvis.make_decision(observation)
print(action)

	4.	This will print the action Jarvis decides to take based on the provided observation.
	5.	Listen to User Speech
You can use Jarvis to transcribe spoken words into text:

spoken_text = jarvis.listen()
print(spoken_text)

	5.	This will print the transcribed text from the spoken words.

These are just a few examples. Results may vary depending on your environment, setup, and use case. 

## Placeholder Functions

The JARVIS2 AI script currently includes a few placeholder functions. They are methods that have been defined but currently lack a concrete implementation. The purpose of these placeholders is to outline the desired functionality and serve as a guide for future development. Here's a brief description of them:

1. `understand_emotion`: This method is intended to analyze the emotional content of an audio input using a pre-trained emotion recognition model. The placeholder is a call to the emotion model's `predict` method, but the preprocessing steps required to convert raw audio data into a suitable format for the model are not yet implemented.

2. `generate_text`: This function is a placeholder for generating conversational responses from JARVIS2. It uses a GPT-3 model to generate text based on a given prompt. Note that to utilize this, you need to have a GPT-3 model readily available.

3. `make_predictive_decision`: This function serves as a placeholder for making predictions based on a data input using a pre-trained predictive model. At present, it calls the `predict` method of an SVM model but doesn't specify how the model is trained or how the input data should be preprocessed.

It's **important to note** that to fully utilize these placeholder functions, you'll need to provide a suitable dataset, perform necessary preprocessing, train or fine-tune the model, and possibly modify the method to suit your specific needs.

## Active-Dev Disclaimer 
Please note that the JARVIS2 AI Project is still in the active development stage. As such, it is likely to contain bugs, glitches, or other issues. These may affect the project’s stability and performance. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work diligently to iron (man) out these issues and improve the system. Please feel free to report any bugs or problems you encounter, and we’ll do our best to address them promptly.
