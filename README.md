# Jarvis2
The real life iron man AI 

# a work in progress
It has always been a dream of mine to have a real life functioning Jarvis AI like seen in the Iron Man movies. It became a real life journey 7/7/2023 when I realized I could utilize the methodology utilized in many other AI projects youll find here on my github, to create a stacked AI project that worked in unison with not just my own custom BiLSTM or bidirectional Long Short Term Memory neural network sets, but all of the seperate components from each of these neat Ai projects could rather, come together, to create the world's most helpful, and possibly, the world's most capable AI. 

## Disclaimer
Jarvis2 is still a long way from factual testing stages, but incorporates the correct flow and components thus far to be a promising new AI companion. Come along with us on this awesome journey into the unknown frontiers of true AI capabilities and limitations. Join us as we set out into this great golden age of the AI forefront!
